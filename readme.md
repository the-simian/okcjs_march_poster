Art:

Most of the art came from the phaser website and appropriated by myself to work in this poster. By that I  mean the spritesheets, background space images and the official phaser logo.

The okcjslogo was created by me (in the style of the official JS logo by VoodooTikiGod)

Filters and REtro font came from the phaser examples.
